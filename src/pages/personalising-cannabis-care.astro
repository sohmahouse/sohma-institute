        <h2 class="wp-section-heading">Contraindications, Interactions and Warnings</h2>

        <!-- Allergy -->
        <h3 id="contra-allergy" class="wp-subsection-heading">Allergy to Cannabis or Constituents in Formulations</h3>

        <p>
          Rare but can happen. Can have reactions to carrier oil especially sesame oil in a few products. Some particular terpenes can cause side effects for individuals.
        </p>

        <!-- Schizophrenia or Previous Psychosis -->
        <h3 id="contra-psychosis" class="wp-subsection-heading">Schizophrenia or Previous Psychosis</h3>

        <p>
          <em>*Note: this is relevant to THC, not CBD. CBD itself is being studied for its potential application as an antipsychotic medication.</em>
        </p>

        <!-- Anxiety Disorders -->
        <h3 id="contra-anxiety" class="wp-subsection-heading">Anxiety Disorders (excluding PTSD)</h3>

        <p>
          The right dose of THC can have significant anxiolytic effects. The wrong dose can worsen anxiety in susceptible individuals. This is due to the bidirectional nature of THC. In the case of anxiety disorders, slower titration protocols are recommended and pairing THC with CBD can widen the therapeutic window and reduce anxiogenic properties of THC.
        </p>

        <!-- Unstable Heart Disease -->
        <h3 id="contra-cardiac" class="wp-subsection-heading">Unstable Heart Disease</h3>

        <p>
          Increased risk of MI after having high dose THC due to the potential induction of tachycardia and subsequent drop in blood pressure, however the actual size of the infarct is reduced due to the cardioprotective nature of cannabinoids.
        </p>

        <blockquote class="wp-callout">
          <p><strong>Extreme caution is recommended for patients with:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Unstable angina</li>
            <li>Difficulty walking up two flights of stairs without experiencing chest pain or significant SOB</li>

        </blockquote>

        <!-- Falls Risk -->
        <h3 id="contra-falls" class="wp-subsection-heading">Falls Risk</h3>

        <p>
          Due to THC's potential to cause motor or cognitive dysfunction, especially with high dose. THC can also cause hypotension so beware patients with postural hypotension. Advise at risk patients to be extra cautious during nocturnal waking to go to bathroom etc.
        </p>

        <!-- Previous Drug Use Disorder -->
        <h3 id="contra-addiction" class="wp-subsection-heading">Previous Drug Use Disorder (Addictive Potential of Cannabis)</h3>

        <p>
          THC predominant medications do have low addictive potential. Reported levels of addiction are between 7&ndash;9% in recreational uses. This is much lower than caffeine, alcohol, cigarettes, benzodiazepines and opioids but still needs to be considered when choosing therapies.
        </p>
        <p>
          Addiction is much more likely to occur in adolescents as the brain is still maturing and in those using concentrates or high percentage THC whole flower via the inhaled route. The inhaled route is more likely to cause addiction due to the instant gratification consumers get which can activate reward pathways. If addiction does occur then withdrawals are unpleasant but mild compared to many other drugs, often quoted as being similar physical symptoms to withdrawing from caffeine.
        </p>
        <p>
          When used appropriately, with intentions aimed at managing symptoms rather than intoxication, cannabis has very low likelihood of addiction and abuse especially in more mature patients. The Sativex (1:1 ratio CBD:THC) trials which are the largest cumulative trials using cannabis to date showed no evidence of abuse or addiction in any of the patients being treated.

        <span class="wp-section-number">Section 03</span>
        <h2 class="wp-section-heading">Layering of Medications</h2>

        <p>
          Patient needs vary through the day with significant variations between day and night functional goals. Also for most people with chronic conditions they can have large variations naturally in the intensity of their symptoms. I often use multiple products within the one patient to use the most appropriate formulation for the patient's needs for a particular time of day.
        </p>
        <p>
          In general I will use more CBD predominant or balanced products during the day. If sleep disturbance is a major issue I will often use more THC predominant treatments at night time. For background symptoms I will use oral or sublingual medications for their longer duration of action. If a patient has an acute flair or breakthrough symptoms I will use the inhaled route on top of their background SR medications to get on top of symptoms quickly.

        <h2 class="wp-section-heading">Prescribing Cannabis to Self-Medicating Patients</h2>

        <p>
          Mankind has had significant and longstanding cultural, spiritual and medicinal relationships with the cannabis plant. The last 90 odd years however have lead to significant changes in that relationship; both in the ways it's used, and in the way we <em>think</em> about its use.
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite prohibition cannabis has remained an integral component in many people's personal medicinal and/or recreational toolkit. However, without the guidance and clarity gleaned through tangible research, clinical insights and pharmacological understanding, that relationship is often sub optimal.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a cannabis practitioner, you will undoubtably come across people with previous cannabis relationships who are looking to legitimise their access. These interactions are an opportunity to re-establish and co-create healthy, sustainable and beneficial relationships between &lsquo;self-medicating&rsquo; patients and their go to medicine, cannabis. To do so involves providing education and meaningful support free from judgement to a group of people used to being perceived through a lens of criminality or shame.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most patients with prior cannabis experience haven't learned how to use cannabis appropriately but how could they when they have been without guidance. Similar to our European counterparts, Australians have generally mixed their cannabis with tobacco for use in either joints or water pipes. The effects experienced under that particular combination, at uncontrolled and often uninformed dosages, may have contributed to a fairly singular idea of what cannabis and its constituents can actually do. Moreover, the inclusion of tobacco within cannabis preparations may also present the challenge of a concurrent nicotine addiction.
        </p>
        <p>
          Education around the benefits of vaporisation, activating the &lsquo;full spectrum&rsquo; of constituents, eliciting deliberate effects, setting intentions, engaging in mindful dosage and administration, understanding that more intoxicating doesn't mean more effective, understanding potential risks and practicing regular tolerance breaks are all key components in establishing these healthy relationships. These patients can be some of the most engaged and excited by the newfound knowledge they are presented with.
