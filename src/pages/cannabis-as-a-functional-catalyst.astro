            Cannabis can serve as a powerful synchroniser, restoring coherence to dysregulated physiological systems.
          </li>
          <li>
            Rather than functioning in isolation, cannabis acts as a catalyst&mdash;amplifying the effects of lifestyle optimisation, foundational health practices, and targeted supplementation.

        <ul>
          <li>
            The ECS interacts dynamically with circadian regulation, inflammatory pathways, glymphatic clearance, and vagal tone.
          </li>
          <li>
            CB1/CB2 modulation has been shown to influence pain perception, immune balance, neuroprotection, and gut permeability.
          </li>
          <li>
            Fascia, rich in endocannabinoid and TRPV1 receptors, acts as a body-wide signalling matrix, amplifying the interoceptive effects of cannabinoid-based therapies.

        <h2 class="wp-section-heading">Optimising Outcomes: Cannabis Within a Broader Ecosystem of Care</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Cannabis is not a standalone solution</strong>, but one tool within a broader functional and integrative model of care. When combined with conventional medicines, targeted supplements, and lifestyle strategies, outcomes are enhanced.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Medication Synergy:</strong> THC may synergise with opioids, allowing for lower opioid doses. Cannabis also interacts with SSRIs, gabapentinoids, and anti-inflammatories&mdash;sometimes enhancing, sometimes moderating their effects.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Clinical Collaboration:</strong> Having another set of trained clinical eyes allows opportunities to optimise not only cannabis regimens, but also adjust conventional medication burden and assess for overlooked deficiencies.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <!-- Foundational Building Blocks for Change -->
        <h3 id="foundational-building-blocks" class="wp-subsection-heading">Foundational Building Blocks for Change</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>
            For cannabis to catalyse functional change, patients need the physiological <em>resources</em> to respond:
            <ul>
              <li>Adequate <strong>protein</strong> intake for tissue repair, neurotransmitter synthesis, and ECS function.</li>
              <li>Sufficient <strong>sunlight</strong>, particularly morning light, for circadian and endocannabinoid rhythm synchrony.</li>
              <li>Regular <strong>movement and fascia hydration</strong>, which enhance interoceptive clarity and improve ECS tone.</li>
              <li><strong>Micronutrient sufficiency</strong>, especially:
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Magnesium</strong> &ndash; essential for ECS resilience, often depleted due to stress and soil depletion.</li>
                  <li><strong>Zinc</strong> &ndash; crucial for cannabinoid receptor function and immune balance.</li>
                  <li><strong>Vitamin D</strong> &ndash; co-modulator of ECS and critical in immune and neuropsychiatric regulation.</li>
                  <li><strong>Omega 3 fatty acids</strong> &ndash; help balance omega 6:3 ratio; excess omega 6 skews toward inflammation and ECS dysfunction.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <!-- Dietary Insights for ECS Support -->
        <h3 id="dietary-insights" class="wp-subsection-heading">Dietary Insights for ECS Support</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Adopt the core principle: <em>&ldquo;Eat real food, not too much, mostly plants.&rdquo;</em>
          </li>
          <li>
            Avoid extreme dietary dogmas. Recognise the risks:
            <ul>
              <li>Strict plant-based diets often lack <strong>B12, iron, zinc, omega 3, and vitamin D</strong>.</li>
              <li>Animal-heavy diets with minimal plant intake reduce <strong>phytonutrient density</strong>, impacting antioxidant and detox pathways.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <!-- Expanding the Use of Cannabis Medicines -->
        <h3 id="expanding-use" class="wp-subsection-heading">Expanding the Use of Cannabis Medicines</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Encourage patients to explore <strong>alternative delivery formats</strong>:
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Cannabis tea</strong> (decarboxylated or raw)</li>
              <li><strong>Raw cannabis juice</strong> (high CBDA, THCA)</li>
              <li><strong>Topicals or baths</strong> for localised ECS activation</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Add terpene isolates</strong> (e.g., myrcene, limonene, &beta;-caryophyllene) to modulate mood, energy, or focus based on individual needs.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <!-- Adjunctive Nutraceuticals -->
        <h3 id="adjunctive-nutraceuticals" class="wp-subsection-heading">Adjunctive Nutraceuticals</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Palmitoylethanolamide (PEA):</strong> an endogenous fatty acid amide, enhances ECS tone, modulates mast cells, and synergises well with both CBD and THC for pain and neuroinflammation.
          </li>
          <li>
            Use PEA as a co-therapy in:
            <ul>
              <li>Neuropathic pain</li>
              <li>Central sensitivity syndromes</li>
              <li>MCAS and neuroinflammatory states</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          This model frames cannabis as a <em>bioregulator</em>&mdash;enhancing system synchrony when foundational building blocks are addressed. The catalyst effect is most evident when paired with lifestyle, nutritional, and psychosocial recalibration.
