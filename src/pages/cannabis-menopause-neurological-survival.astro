        <p>
          Menopause is not a disease. It is one of the most profound neurobiological transitions in the human lifespan, and yet it remains among the most poorly understood and clinically underserved. As estrogen declines, the endocannabinoid system (ECS) undergoes parallel destabilisation, creating a cascade of dysregulation across the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, the autonomic nervous system (ANS), and the neurological architecture that governs threat perception and survival response. The result, for many women, is a body locked in chronic sympathetic activation: fight, flight, freeze, or fawn states that persist long after the perceived threat has passed.
        </p>
        <p>
          This article synthesises peer-reviewed research across endocrinology, neuroscience, autonomic physiology, and cannabinoid pharmacology to propose a clinical framework for understanding menopausal symptomatology as a state of <em>allostatic overload</em> driven by the convergent collapse of estrogen and endocannabinoid signalling. It examines the variable effects of cannabis formulations across the hormonal cycle and into perimenopause and postmenopause, positioning cannabis medicine not as a replacement for hormonal therapy but as a sophisticated regulatory intervention with the potential to restore autonomic coherence, modulate survival mode neurology, and support the body's return to adaptive homeostasis.

        <h2 class="wp-section-heading">The Convergent Crisis: Estrogen Decline and Endocannabinoid Destabilisation</h2>

        <p>
          The endocannabinoid system and the estrogen system are not merely adjacent physiological networks. They are deeply interpenetrated regulatory partners whose functional interdependence has been systematically underestimated by mainstream clinical science. A 2021 review in the <em>International Journal of Molecular Sciences</em> mapped the complex crosstalk between the ECS and the estrogen system at both central and peripheral levels, documenting how estrogen receptors and cannabinoid receptors share overlapping distributions in the hypothalamus, hippocampus, amygdala, and prefrontal cortex (Santoro et al., 2021). These are precisely the neural structures responsible for emotional regulation, memory consolidation, threat appraisal, and stress response.
        </p>
        <p>
          The bidirectional nature of this relationship is critical. Estradiol directly upregulates the synthesis of anandamide (AEA), the body's primary endogenous cannabinoid, while simultaneously downregulating fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH), the enzyme that degrades it. The net effect of healthy estrogen levels is elevated endocannabinoid tone. In premenopausal women, circulating anandamide is highest during the follicular phase and peaks at ovulation, mirroring the estradiol curve (El-Talatini et al., 2009; Habayeb et al., 2004). As estrogen declines through perimenopause and collapses in postmenopause, anandamide synthesis decreases while FAAH activity rises unchecked. The system loses its primary endogenous buffer.
        </p>
        <p>
          Italian researchers have proposed that this estrogen-dependent drop in anandamide may partially explain the increased risk of cancer, osteoporosis, and cardiovascular disease in postmenopausal women, given anandamide's established antitumoral, osteoprotective, and cardioprotective properties (Torella et al., 2021). CB2 receptor expression, essential for healthy bone formation, weakens as estrogen declines, and this loss of CB2 signalling has been linked to the accelerated osteoclast activity that drives postmenopausal osteoporosis (Rossi et al., 2013).
        </p>
        <p>
          What emerges from this literature is not a simple hormonal deficiency. It is a <em>convergent destabilisation</em> of two of the body's most fundamental regulatory systems. When both estrogen and endocannabinoid tone decline simultaneously, the organism loses its capacity for homeostatic self-regulation at precisely the moment its physiological demands intensify. The clinical expression of this convergent crisis is what we call menopausal symptoms. Its deeper identity is a body that has lost its primary instruments of internal coherence.

        <h2 class="wp-section-heading">Allostatic Overload: The Body That Cannot Return to Baseline</h2>

        <p>
          The concept of allostatic load, introduced by McEwen and Stellar (1993), describes the cumulative physiological cost of chronic adaptation to stress. Allostatic overload occurs when the burden exceeds the organism's adaptive capacity, producing a state in which the stress response systems themselves become pathological. The HPA axis, designed to mobilise cortisol in response to acute threat and then return to baseline, instead becomes tonically activated, producing elevated cortisol, disrupted diurnal rhythms, and progressive exhaustion of regulatory feedback mechanisms.
        </p>
        <p>
          The menopausal transition is an underrecognised driver of allostatic overload. Research from the Seattle Midlife Women's Health Study found that 68% of women transitioning from middle to late perimenopause exhibited significant increases in cortisol, with magnitudes previously associated with measurable decrements in cognitive performance (Woods et al., 2009). A novel heuristic model published in <em>Frontiers in Psychology</em> proposes that ovarian hormone fluctuation during the menopausal transition triggers HPA axis dysregulation through alterations in allopregnanolone, a progesterone-derived neurosteroid that positively modulates GABA-A receptors. As progesterone declines, allopregnanolone levels fall, reducing GABAergic inhibition of the HPA axis and effectively removing the neurological brake on cortisol production (Gordon et al., 2015).
        </p>
        <p>
          The implications are severe. Without adequate GABAergic modulation, the HPA axis becomes sensitised to stress, producing exaggerated cortisol responses to stimuli that would previously have been managed within normal adaptive range. Estrogen's established role in inhibiting HPA overactivation compounds the problem: ovariectomized animal models demonstrate that low-dose estradiol attenuates the stress-induced ACTH response, while estrogen antagonists amplify it. The perimenopausal woman is therefore experiencing a dual loss of cortisol regulation: the GABAergic brake weakens as progesterone falls, and the estrogenic modulation of the HPA axis dissolves simultaneously.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is not a metaphor for dysfunction. It is a measurable, mechanistic account of how the menopausal body enters and sustains a state of allostatic overload. The clinical consequences include persistent insomnia, cognitive fragmentation, affective volatility, chronic pain amplification, immune dysregulation, and cardiovascular risk. These are not discrete "symptoms" to be managed individually. They are expressions of a single underlying state: a regulatory system that has lost its capacity to return to baseline.

        <h2 class="wp-section-heading">Survival Mode Neurology: The Autonomic Architecture of Menopausal Distress</h2>

        <p>
          Stephen Porges' polyvagal theory provides an essential neurophysiological framework for understanding why menopausal women so frequently describe feeling "stuck" in states of anxiety, hypervigilance, emotional shutdown, or compulsive accommodation. Polyvagal theory identifies three hierarchical states of the autonomic nervous system, each associated with distinct behavioural and physiological profiles: the ventral vagal complex (social engagement, safety, and restoration), the sympathetic nervous system (fight or flight mobilisation), and the dorsal vagal complex (freeze, dissociation, and metabolic conservation).
        </p>
        <p>
          In a regulated nervous system, the ventral vagal pathway provides a tonic brake on sympathetic activation, dampening the HPA axis, slowing the heart rate, and inhibiting fight-flight mechanisms (Porges, 2009). This ventral vagal brake is what allows the organism to remain in a state of social engagement, restful digestion, and adaptive flexibility. When the brake is compromised, the nervous system defaults to phylogenetically older survival strategies: sympathetic mobilisation (fight, flight), and if that fails, dorsal vagal immobilisation (freeze, collapse, dissociation). The fawn response, an adaptive strategy in which the organism attempts to pacify a perceived threat through compliance and relational accommodation, represents a hybrid autonomic state combining elements of sympathetic activation and dorsal vagal submission.
        </p>
        <p>
          The convergent loss of estrogen and endocannabinoid tone during menopause directly impairs ventral vagal function. The ECS modulates the autonomic nervous system at multiple levels: CB1 receptors are densely expressed in the hypothalamus, amygdala, prefrontal cortex, and brainstem nuclei that regulate both sympathetic and parasympathetic outflow. Research demonstrates that endocannabinoid signalling constrains sympathetic activation and supports parasympathetic recovery following stress (Hill et al., 2010; Hillard, 2014). When endocannabinoid tone collapses, the autonomic nervous system loses one of its primary mechanisms for returning to ventral vagal safety.
        </p>
        <p>
          The clinical picture becomes clearer: the menopausal woman experiencing chronic anxiety, sleep disruption, emotional reactivity, and cognitive fog is not simply "symptomatic." She is living in a nervous system that has been neurochemically shifted toward survival mode. The ventral vagal brake has weakened. The sympathetic system runs unchecked. The dorsal vagal pathway activates more readily, producing episodes of numbness, dissociation, or the flatness that many women describe as "not feeling like myself." <strong>The symptoms are not the pathology. The autonomic state is the pathology.</strong> The symptoms are its faithful expression.

        <h2 class="wp-section-heading">Decoupling from Fight/Flight/Freeze/Fawn: The Endocannabinoid System as Autonomic Regulator</h2>

        <p>
          The endocannabinoid system's role in stress response regulation is now among the most robust findings in behavioural neuroscience. A comprehensive review in <em>Neuropsychopharmacology</em> (Hill et al., 2015) established that stress evokes bidirectional changes in the two primary endocannabinoids: anandamide (AEA) decreases while 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) increases. The decline in AEA appears to <em>initiate</em> the stress response, contributing to HPA axis activation and anxiety behaviour, while the rise in 2-AG contributes to <em>terminating</em> the stress response, constraining neuronal activation and facilitating adaptation.
        </p>
        <p>
          This bidirectional function has profound implications for the menopausal context. In a system where basal AEA levels are already depressed due to estrogen decline, the threshold for stress activation is lowered. Less stimulus is required to trigger the full cascade of sympathetic arousal, HPA axis activation, and survival mode engagement. Simultaneously, the 2-AG termination pathway may be compromised by the broader endocannabinoid destabilisation, meaning that once the stress response activates, it persists longer and recovers more slowly.
        </p>
        <p>
          CB1 receptor signalling in the amygdala, prefrontal cortex, and paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN) has been shown to both inhibit and potentiate HPA axis activation depending on context and receptor location (Tasker et al., 2015). Within the amygdala, CRH (corticotropin-releasing hormone) actively drives anandamide hydrolysis, creating a local environment of reduced endocannabinoid tone that facilitates anxiety and threat vigilance (Gray et al., 2015). In the PVN, glucocorticoids recruit endocannabinoid signalling as part of a rapid negative feedback mechanism: cortisol triggers endocannabinoid release, which then suppresses further CRH secretion. This is the system's own brake pedal. When endocannabinoid tone is depleted, the brake fails.
        </p>
        <p>
          Crucially, chronic stress itself degrades the ECS. Repeated stress exposure reliably downregulates CB1 receptors across virtually every brain region examined (Hill et al., 2015). This creates a progressive erosion: the menopausal woman whose endocannabinoid system is already compromised by estrogen loss enters a reinforcing cycle where the stress generated by that compromise further degrades the system meant to regulate it. The organism moves deeper into survival mode not because external threats increase, but because the internal apparatus for recognising and resolving threat has been systematically weakened.

        <h2 class="wp-section-heading">Endocannabinoid Fluctuations Across the Hormonal Cycle: Implications for Cannabis Prescribing</h2>

        <p>
          One of the most clinically significant findings in recent endocannabinoid research is the degree to which ECS activity varies across the menstrual cycle. RNA sequencing of endometrial tissue has identified 29 genes within the endocannabinoid system that demonstrate significant differential expression across cycle phases, with four distinct regulation patterns for synthesising enzymes and a separate pattern for degradation and transport enzymes (Mortlock et al., 2022). This is not marginal variation. It is a fundamentally dynamic system whose regulatory architecture reshapes itself on a monthly basis.
        </p>
        <p>
          Plasma anandamide levels are highest during the estrogen-dominant follicular phase and at ovulation, declining during the progesterone-dominant luteal phase. FAAH expression increases in the secretory phase, actively promoting endocannabinoid degradation. CB1 and CB2 receptor expression in the endometrium fluctuates across the cycle, with CB2 playing distinct roles in bone remodelling and immune modulation that track with hormonal shifts.
        </p>
        <p>
          The clinical implications for cannabis prescribing are substantial. A woman in her late luteal phase, when endocannabinoid tone is naturally at its lowest, may experience greater sensitivity to exogenous cannabinoids and potentially greater therapeutic benefit from cannabis-based interventions. Conversely, during the follicular phase, when endogenous anandamide is high and ECS activity is robust, the same formulation may produce a different pharmacological response. These are not speculative projections. They follow directly from the established pharmacology: the effect of an exogenous ligand depends on the receptor density and endogenous tone of the system it enters.
        </p>
        <p>
          As the menstrual cycle becomes increasingly erratic during perimenopause, these fluctuations become unpredictable. Cycles lengthen, shorten, or skip entirely. Estrogen surges and crashes irregularly. The ECS tracks these oscillations, producing variable endocannabinoid states that may shift week to week. This variability explains why many perimenopausal women report that cannabis "works differently" at different times, and why static dosing protocols are inadequate for this population. What is needed is adaptive, cycle-aware prescribing that accounts for the hormonal terrain the patient is navigating at the time of intervention.

        <h2 class="wp-section-heading">Cannabis Formulations and Menopausal Therapeutics: Variable Effects of THC, CBD, and the Entourage</h2>

        <p>
          The pharmacological complexity of cannabis is both its clinical challenge and its therapeutic advantage. THC and CBD interact with the endocannabinoid system through different mechanisms, and their effects are further modulated by the hormonal milieu in which they are administered.
        </p>

        <!-- THC and the Menopausal HPA Axis -->
        <h3 id="thc-hpa-axis" class="wp-subsection-heading">THC and the Menopausal HPA Axis</h3>

        <p>
          THC binds directly to CB1 and CB2 receptors and is the primary psychoactive constituent of cannabis. Its relationship with the HPA axis is dose-dependent and biphasic: low doses of THC tend to reduce cortisol and produce anxiolytic effects, while higher doses can stimulate ACTH and cortisol release and may exacerbate anxiety in susceptible individuals. In the menopausal context, where cortisol regulation is already impaired, this biphasic profile demands careful titration. THC's capacity to reduce muscle sympathetic nerve activity and increase vascular conductance positions it as a potential modulator of vasomotor symptoms, though clinical trial data remain lacking.
        </p>
        <p>
          THC also exerts significant effects on the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis. It indirectly decreases GnRH secretion through modulation of glutamate and GABA neurotransmission and can inhibit steroidogenesis by preventing the conversion of pregnenolone to progesterone. In premenopausal women, these effects carry fertility implications. In postmenopausal women, where ovarian steroidogenesis has already ceased, these HPG effects become largely irrelevant, and the therapeutic window for THC's autonomic and HPA-modulating properties widens.
        </p>

        <!-- CBD and Autonomic Regulation -->
        <h3 id="cbd-autonomic" class="wp-subsection-heading">CBD and Autonomic Regulation</h3>

        <p>
          CBD does not bind directly to CB1 or CB2 receptors with high affinity. Instead, it acts as an inverse agonist at CB2, a positive allosteric modulator at certain receptor sites, and interacts with serotonin 5-HT1A receptors, TRPV1 channels, and PPAR-gamma nuclear receptors. Its pharmacological profile is that of a broad-spectrum modulator rather than a direct agonist.
        </p>
        <p>
          Research by Zuardi et al. (1993) demonstrated that CBD interferes with cortisol secretion in human volunteers, attenuating the normal diurnal decline in cortisol at doses of 300mg and 600mg. This finding suggests that CBD may modulate HPA axis dynamics in ways that are distinct from its anxiolytic properties. A landmark study published in the <em>Journal of Physiology</em> (2021) demonstrated that CBD activates vagal afferent neurons through TRPA1 channels, providing a direct mechanism by which CBD may enhance parasympathetic tone and support the ventral vagal brake that is so often compromised in menopausal autonomic dysfunction.
        </p>
        <p>
          CBD's neuroprotective, anti-inflammatory, and osteoprotective properties are additionally relevant. Preclinical research at Rutgers University (2022) found that CBD improved bone health, gut microbiome diversity, and energy metabolism in postmenopausal mouse models, effects that are particularly significant given that hormone replacement therapy is contraindicated for women over sixty.
        </p>

        <!-- The Entourage and Formulation Strategy -->
        <h3 id="entourage-formulation" class="wp-subsection-heading">The Entourage and Formulation Strategy</h3>

        <p>
          The therapeutic potential of cannabis for menopausal women cannot be reduced to THC or CBD in isolation. The entourage effect, the synergistic interaction between cannabinoids, terpenes, and flavonoids in whole-plant preparations, modulates bioavailability, receptor binding kinetics, and side-effect profiles in ways that isolate compounds cannot replicate. Survey data consistently show that women using cannabis for menopausal symptoms report the greatest benefit from balanced THC:CBD ratios, often in the range of 1:1 to 1:3, delivered via sublingual tinctures or edibles rather than inhalation (Dahlgren et al., 2022).
        </p>
        <p>
          Formulation strategy for the menopausal population should account for several pharmacological realities. First, postmenopausal women metabolise THC differently from younger women because estrogen, which is part of the metabolic pathway for endocannabinoid processing, is no longer present at premenopausal levels. This altered metabolism may produce different onset times, peak concentrations, and duration of effects. Second, the specific symptom profile, whether vasomotor, neuropsychiatric, musculoskeletal, or mixed, should guide cannabinoid selection. Third, delivery method matters: sublingual and oral routes provide slower onset and longer duration, offering more stable autonomic modulation than inhalation, which produces rapid fluctuations in plasma cannabinoid levels.

        <h2 class="wp-section-heading">Perimenopause as Neuroendocrine Turbulence: The Case for Adaptive Cannabis Protocols</h2>

        <p>
          Perimenopause, frequently characterised as the "second puberty," is not a gradual decline. It is a period of erratic, unpredictable hormonal oscillation during which estrogen can surge to levels higher than normal reproductive range before crashing precipitously. Progesterone declines more steadily, and the ratio between the two hormones becomes increasingly unstable. The ECS, yoked to these fluctuations through the estrogen-FAAH-anandamide axis, oscillates in parallel.
        </p>
        <p>
          Survey research published in <em>Menopause</em> (Dahlgren et al., 2022) found that 86% of perimenopausal and postmenopausal women with an interest in cannabis reported current use, with 78.7% endorsing cannabis for menopause-related symptoms. Sleep disturbance (67.4%), mood and anxiety (46.1%), and low libido (30.4%) were the most commonly targeted symptoms. Perimenopausal participants reported higher incidence of depression and anxiety compared to postmenopausal participants, and were more likely to use cannabis specifically for mood and anxiety management.
        </p>
        <p>
          A Canadian survey of nearly 1,500 midlife women presented at the North American Menopause Society (NAMS) Annual Meeting found that among current cannabis users, 75% reported the medicine as helpful for their symptoms, with sleep issues (65%), anxiety (45%), and musculoskeletal discomfort (33%) as primary targets. Notably, more women were using cannabis to manage menopause symptoms than were using hormone therapy, a finding that underscores the unmet need in this population and the inadequacy of current clinical offerings.
        </p>
        <p>
          The clinical imperative is clear: static prescribing does not serve this population. What is needed is an adaptive protocol framework that accounts for the hormonal turbulence of perimenopause, the stabilisation of postmenopause, and the individual's autonomic profile. Cycle tracking, symptom mapping, and regular reassessment of cannabis formulation, dosage, and delivery method should be standard clinical practice for menopausal cannabis patients. The medicine must be as responsive as the biology it seeks to harmonise.

        <h2 class="wp-section-heading">Harmonisation as a Clinical Philosophy: Beyond Symptom Suppression</h2>

        <p>
          The conventional medical approach to menopause treats symptoms as discrete problems requiring discrete solutions: SSRIs for mood, hypnotics for sleep, bisphosphonates for bone, statins for cardiovascular risk. This fragmented approach reflects the same reductionist paradigm that has limited cannabis medicine to a "pill for an ill" model. The research synthesised in this article suggests an entirely different clinical philosophy, one grounded in the concept of <em>harmonisation</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Harmonisation recognises that the menopausal body is not broken. It is in transition. The dysregulation it experiences arises not from pathology but from the convergent destabilisation of regulatory systems that, for decades, maintained coherence through the partnership of estrogen and endocannabinoid signalling. Cannabis, when deployed with clinical sophistication, has the potential to re-enter this regulatory conversation not as a replacement for estrogen but as an external source of cannabinoid intelligence that the body can use to re-establish autonomic coherence.
        </p>
        <p>
          This means supporting the ventral vagal pathway back toward social engagement and safety. It means modulating the HPA axis toward cortisol rhythms that support rather than sabotage sleep, cognition, and emotional processing. It means providing the nervous system with the cannabinoid tone it needs to recognise that the survival mode it has adopted is no longer adaptive, that the threat is not external but internal, and that the body's own regulatory intelligence, supported by the right medicine at the right time, can find its way back to equilibrium.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is not a claim that cannabis resolves menopause. Menopause does not require resolution. It requires accompaniment: attentive, intelligent, pharmacologically informed care that respects the transition and supports the body's own capacity for reorganisation. The endocannabinoid system is the body's oldest and most fundamental homeostatic regulator. In the menopausal woman, it is also the system most in need of therapeutic partnership.

        <h2 class="wp-section-heading">Research Frontiers and Future Directions</h2>

        <p>
          The research landscape presented in this synthesis opens multiple pathways for further investigation. Each represents both a gap in current knowledge and an opportunity for clinical innovation.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>ECS phenotyping across menopausal stages.</strong> No longitudinal study has tracked endocannabinoid levels, CB1/CB2 receptor expression, and FAAH activity across the full menopausal transition in human subjects. Such a study would provide the foundational data for cycle-aware and stage-aware cannabis prescribing.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Cannabinoid-HPA axis interaction in perimenopause.</strong> Research on the HPA axis in perimenopause is remarkably limited compared to other reproductive stages. Studies examining cortisol reactivity (not merely basal levels) in perimenopausal cannabis users versus non-users would clarify whether exogenous cannabinoids restore stress-termination capacity.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Vagal tone and cannabis in menopausal populations.</strong> Heart rate variability (HRV) is an accessible biomarker for vagal tone. Research correlating cannabis use with HRV changes in menopausal women would provide objective, measurable evidence for autonomic regulatory effects.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Formulation-specific outcomes.</strong> Comparative studies examining THC-dominant, CBD-dominant, and balanced formulations across specific symptom clusters (vasomotor, neuropsychiatric, musculoskeletal) would move the field beyond survey data toward evidence-based formulation guidelines.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Clinical endocannabinoid deficiency and menopause.</strong> Ethan Russo's clinical endocannabinoid deficiency (CECD) hypothesis proposes that certain conditions arise from deficient endocannabinoid tone. The convergent loss of estrogen and anandamide in menopause may represent a hormonal subtype of CECD. This deserves formal investigation.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Sensory and somatic integration.</strong> The role of cannabis in supporting somatic awareness, interoceptive capacity, and body-based processing during the menopausal transition is unexplored in formal research. Given the somatic intensity of menopausal symptoms (hot flashes, crawling skin, pelvic floor changes), this is a domain where cannabis-assisted somatic therapy could yield significant clinical value.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Neurosteroid-cannabinoid interactions.</strong> The relationship between declining allopregnanolone (a progesterone-derived neurosteroid and GABA-A modulator) and endocannabinoid tone has been hypothesised but not experimentally mapped. This intersection may hold the key to understanding why certain women are more vulnerable to perimenopausal mood disorders.

        <h2 class="wp-section-heading">Conclusion: Toward a Cannabis Medicine That Honours the Transition</h2>

        <p>
          Menopause is one of the great reorganisations of the female body. It is not a failure of biology but an evolutionary threshold, and like all thresholds, it demands that the organism relinquish old regulatory strategies and develop new ones. The endocannabinoid system, deeply entwined with the estrogen system that has maintained homeostatic coherence for decades, undergoes its own parallel reorganisation. When this process is unsupported, the result is a nervous system trapped in survival mode, an HPA axis running without a brake, and a woman who may spend years in a state of allostatic overload that conventional medicine addresses only piecemeal.
        </p>
        <p>
          Cannabis medicine, practiced with the pharmacological sophistication and relational intelligence this transition demands, has the potential to serve as a regulatory bridge. Not a cure. Not a suppression. A bridge: supporting the endocannabinoid system while it finds its new equilibrium in a low-estrogen environment, modulating the autonomic nervous system toward coherence, and providing the body with the signal it most needs during this passage, that it is safe, and that it can come home from survival mode.
        </p>
        <p>
          The research is young but the convergence is unmistakable. Endocrinology, neuroscience, autonomic physiology, and cannabinoid pharmacology are arriving at the same territory from different directions. The clinician who can synthesise these streams and translate them into responsive, adaptive, patient-centred care stands at the frontier of what cannabis medicine can become.
        </p>
        <p>
          The body knows how to transition. Our task is to ensure it has what it needs to do so with grace.
